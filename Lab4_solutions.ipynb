    "## Lab 4 - Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "The past few labs have dealt with basic programming concepts such as opening and closing files and writing structured code. While these concepts are important to know in order for us to do computational text analysis, we need text to use these concepts on. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to obtain text:\n",
    "* Retrieving text from a pre-existing corpus\n",
    "* Creating your own corpus through web-scraping or other means\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will be looking into web-scraping and how we can create our very own dataset. Read through the following tutorial as it is a very good introduction to web scraping: [Python web scraping](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a very easy to use web-scraping module called 'BeautifulSoup' that we will be learning to use. But before we can start writing our scraper we need to identify where we are getting our data from and what the layout of the website is.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this lab, we will be scraping some reviews for the Black Panther movie at [rotten tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_panther_2018/reviews?type=&sort=)\n",
    "We need to understand how a website is structured. A website is built up of blocks of html tags and it is these tags that are important for web scraping. We need to find the specific tag that identifies individual reviews on the webpage. The simplest way to do so on Chrome is to right click on the review and click \"inspect\" at the bottom of the pop up list. This will open a window that shows the html content of the page. As you move your cursor over the code it will highlight the element on the actual webpage. You need to find the html tag that corresponds to a review as shown in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![html](./image1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The particular element we are interested in is a class tag. The class tag is used to group similar items together for ease of structuring. In the case of Rotten Tomatoes all reviews have the \"the_review\" class assigned to them which is highlighted in the image above. Now that we have this information we can write the code that retrieves the reviews that we want to scrape. In order to do this we will use the \"requests\" module to request access to the site and then we will use BeautifulSoup to scrape the webpage contents and parse the html."

In order to have a big enough dataset to be useful, we will need to scrape all the pages containing reviews. For this example it will be fairly easy. Notice that the url we used contains the following string: \"&page=1\". We can use that string to loop through all the pages containing reviews. In the next code block we will re-code our scraper to loop through each page. We will retrieve the author and review text. It is up to you to complete the code and store the data to a pandas dataframe.\n",
